## Lexer notes

> It is a C function that returns an integer, which is a code for one of the possible token names. The attribute value, whether it be another numeric code, a pointer to the symbol table, or nothing, is placed in a global variable `yylval` (in our case — `cool_yylval`), which is shared between the lexical analyzer and parser, thereby making it simple to return both the name and an attribute value of a token.
